### Problem Statement (problem_statement.md)

Maintaining a balanced and healthy diet is a critical aspect of well-being, yet many individuals struggle to track their daily calorie intake and evaluate the nutritional value of their meals. This difficulty often stems from a lack of clear, organized data about what they are consuming and how it fits into a broader nutritional framework. 

The **Calorie Tracker: Daily Meal and Nutrition Analysis** project seeks to bridge this gap by leveraging data analysis to offer a comprehensive view of daily meal consumption and caloric intake. By merging meal timing data with caloric data, the project provides insights into eating habits, highlights patterns across different meals, and identifies opportunities for dietary improvements. This analysis can serve as a foundation for making more informed and healthier dietary choices, enabling individuals to better manage their nutritional intake.

#### Key Challenges:
1. Lack of visibility into the distribution of calorie intake across different meals during the day.
2. Difficulty identifying high-calorie meals and their impact on overall diet.
3. Need for clear and interpretable visualizations to make daily caloric trends understandable.

#### Project Goals:
- To analyze and visualize caloric intake data across different meal times (breakfast, lunch, snacks, dinner).
- To identify meals with high calorie content and offer recommendations for more balanced alternatives.
- To provide insights that support healthier eating patterns by offering a clear view of daily nutrition intake through interactive data analysis.
